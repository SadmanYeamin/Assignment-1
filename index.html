                Due to the unfamiliar development environment and tools, the design process is not as perfect as it should be: architect, design, code, and test. Rather than that, one may meet the following: architect, prototype, test â€“ "Oops, I can't do that" or "Oh, that's how it's meant to operate," which results in: re-architect, re-prototype, re-test, re-oops, repeat. The code establishes a connection between the adjustments. The design is the code's jumbled artifact.
